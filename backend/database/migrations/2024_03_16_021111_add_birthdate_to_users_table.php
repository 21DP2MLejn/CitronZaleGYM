It seems that the migration file is still attempting to use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log, which is causing the fatal error.

In Laravel migrations, you typically do not use facades like Log. If you need to log something during a migration, you should use the info, warning, or error methods provided by the Schema facade.

Here's how you can update your migration file to remove the reference to Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log:

php
Copy code
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class AddBirthdateToUsersTable extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->date('birthdate')->nullable();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->dropColumn('birthdate');
        });
    }
}
